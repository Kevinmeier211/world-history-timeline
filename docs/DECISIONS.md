# Decisions

Local, reversible choices consistent with the plan. Format: date, decision, alternatives, why, reversible.

## 2026-10-25 — Phase branches stay on the names in the plan

Decision: Work lands on `v2/p0-tooling`, then `v2/p1-data`, and so on. Completed phases merge with `--no-ff` into `v2/main`. `main` is not touched.

Alternatives: A single `cursor/…` branch for the whole run.

Why: Kevin named these branches in the approved plan and in the run instructions. `ALLOW_PUSH` is false, so the branches stay local.

Reversible? y
