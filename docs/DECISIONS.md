# Decisions

Local, reversible choices consistent with the plan. Format: date, decision, alternatives, why, reversible.

## 2026-10-25 — Phase branches stay on the names in the plan

Decision: Work lands on `v2/p0-tooling`, then `v2/p1-data`, and so on. Completed phases merge with `--no-ff` into `v2/main`. `main` is not touched.

Alternatives: A single `cursor/…` branch for the whole run.

Why: Kevin named these branches in the approved plan and in the run instructions. `ALLOW_PUSH` is false, so the branches stay local.

## 2026-10-25 — `@types/node` for configs and scripts

Decision: Dev-dependency `@types/node` is installed so `vite.config.ts` and later `scripts/` can import Node builtins under `tsc -b`.

Alternatives: Keep configs out of `tsc` and use URL-only aliases with no Node import.

Why: T0.07 requires `tsc -b` to typecheck the Vite and Playwright configs, and every later script is TypeScript on Node. This is not a runtime dependency and is under the size switch.

Reversible? y

## 2026-10-25 — Design lint skips v1 until it is deleted

Decision: `scripts/design-lint.ts` does not scan `index.html` or the v1 app (`src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/components/`, `src/styles/app.css`, `src/utils/`). The five §13.6 rules still run on every other file, and unit tests cover each rule.

Alternatives: Fail `design:lint` on v1 now, or loosen the rules so the current CSS passes.

Why: T0.11 still needs an untouched v1 screenshot, and T3.01 / T3.16 are the tasks that remove Google fonts and the old canvas. The allowlist is a constant asserted by a test so it cannot grow quietly.

Reversible? y

## 2026-10-25 — Year 0 is invalid data, and endpoints are explicit

Decision: Schema years reject `0`. Alternative political ends (Safavid 1722/1736 and the like) go in optional `endpoints` notes instead of a second silent `end`.

Alternatives: Allow `0` and map it only at display time. Store one end and mention the other only in prose.

Why: The date policy says display has no year 0 and debated ends must not be chosen silently. Rejecting `0` in the schema makes the mistake fail validation.
